#🚀 Automated Lunar Crater Detection using Chandrayaan-2’s TMC-2 Images 🌑

Excited to share my latest project inspired by research on Automated Lunar Crater Detection using images from Chandrayaan-2’s Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2). Leveraging deep learning, I’ve built a system based on U-Net with a ResNet18 backbone to identify and segment lunar craters from high-resolution satellite images.

🌕 Chandrayaan-2’s TMC-2: Mapping the Moon in 3D

The Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2) onboard Chandrayaan-2 provides high-resolution stereo images of the Moon with a 5-meter spatial resolution. These images, captured from multiple angles, help in studying the Moon’s topography, craters, ridges, and valleys, offering insights into its geological history.

🧬 Deep Learning for Crater Detection

🔹 Model Architecture: U-Net with ResNet18 Backbone
	•	U-Net is a powerful image segmentation model that excels at identifying objects in complex visual data.
	•	ResNet18, used as the backbone, enhances feature extraction by capturing both low-level and high-level features.
	•	This combination accurately detects and segments lunar craters, aiding planetary science and automated analysis.

🔍 Why This Matters?

✅ Advances Lunar Exploration: Automating crater detection accelerates lunar surface mapping and analysis.
✅ Improves Geological Understanding: Helps scientists study impact craters, providing clues about lunar history.
✅ Boosts AI in Space Research: Showcases the power of deep learning in analyzing celestial bodies.
